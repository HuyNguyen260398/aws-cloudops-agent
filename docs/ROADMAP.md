# üöÄ AWS CloudOps Agent - Infrastructure Management Roadmap

This document outlines planned enhancements to transform the AWS CloudOps Agent into a comprehensive infrastructure management solution.

## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Management Enhancements

### 1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Integration**
- **CloudFormation/CDK Support**: Parse, validate, and deploy templates
- **Terraform Integration**: Read .tf files and suggest improvements
- **Template Generation**: Create IaC templates from requirements
- **Drift Detection**: Compare actual resources with IaC definitions

### 2. **Cost Optimization Tools**
- **Resource Right-sizing**: Analyze EC2/RDS usage and suggest optimal sizes
- **Cost Anomaly Detection**: Monitor spending patterns and alert on unusual costs
- **Reserved Instance Recommendations**: Analyze usage patterns for RI opportunities
- **Unused Resource Detection**: Identify idle or underutilized resources
- **Cost Forecasting**: Predict future costs based on usage trends

### 3. **Security & Compliance**
- **Security Group Auditing**: Check for overly permissive rules and unused groups
- **IAM Policy Analysis**: Review permissions and suggest least privilege principles
- **Compliance Scanning**: AWS Config rules validation and remediation
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Security findings from Inspector and GuardDuty
- **Encryption Compliance**: Ensure data encryption at rest and in transit

### 4. **Monitoring & Alerting**
- **CloudWatch Integration**: Create custom dashboards and intelligent alarms
- **Log Analysis**: Parse CloudTrail/VPC Flow Logs for security and performance insights
- **Health Checks**: Automated infrastructure health monitoring and reporting
- **Performance Metrics**: Track and optimize application performance
- **Custom Metrics**: Create business-specific monitoring solutions

### 5. **Automation Workflows**
- **Backup Automation**: Schedule and manage automated backups across services
- **Patch Management**: Systems Manager integration for OS and application patching
- **Auto-remediation**: Automatically fix common infrastructure issues
- **Scaling Automation**: Intelligent auto-scaling based on custom metrics
- **Maintenance Windows**: Coordinate maintenance activities across resources

### 6. **Multi-Account Management**
- **AWS Organizations**: Manage multiple accounts and organizational units
- **Cross-account Resource Discovery**: Unified view and management across accounts
- **Centralized Logging**: Aggregate logs and metrics from multiple accounts
- **Policy Management**: Centralized governance and compliance policies
- **Cost Allocation**: Track and allocate costs across business units

### 7. **Disaster Recovery**
- **DR Planning**: Create and test comprehensive disaster recovery procedures
- **Cross-region Replication**: Setup and monitor data replication strategies
- **RTO/RPO Calculations**: Analyze and optimize recovery time/point objectives
- **Backup Validation**: Automated testing of backup integrity and restoration
- **Failover Automation**: Automated failover and failback procedures

### 8. **Enhanced RAG System**
- **AWS Documentation Ingestion**: Auto-update knowledge base with latest AWS documentation
- **Best Practices Database**: Industry-specific and workload-specific recommendations
- **Incident Knowledge Base**: Learn from past incidents and solutions
- **Architecture Patterns**: Store and recommend proven architecture patterns
- **Troubleshooting Guides**: Step-by-step problem resolution procedures

## üéØ Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Foundation)
1. **IaC Integration** - CloudFormation/CDK support
2. **Cost Optimization** - Basic cost analysis and recommendations
3. **Security Auditing** - Security group and IAM policy analysis

### Phase 2 (Operations)
4. **Enhanced Monitoring** - Advanced CloudWatch integration
5. **Automation Workflows** - Basic auto-remediation capabilities
6. **Enhanced RAG** - AWS documentation ingestion

### Phase 3 (Enterprise)
7. **Multi-Account Management** - Organizations and cross-account features
8. **Disaster Recovery** - Comprehensive DR planning and automation

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Considerations
